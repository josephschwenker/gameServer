TODO
	Convert to model-view-controller
		Separate View, Controller for each UI element?
			MapModel, MapView, MapController
	Port Model to Node.js
	Port View to React
	
	Do not display "next unit" while base control open
	Animations on units when moving:
		Cannot simply clear the map and redraw it
		A: Pieces are contained in an overlay with position: fixed. When they are created, the View puts them in the pieceContainer where they stay until the unit is disbanded or destroyed. When rendering, the positions are animated from one tile to the next like in Pandora: First Contact. NOT in a direct line. Thus the transition will have to have steps and "scoot" to each intermediate position.
		We will need to re-initialize on every window paint.
	Slide units from one tile to the next when moving (position: absolute)
	Units should be centered in tile
	Queue moves for next turn
			Do not store path, just recompute the shortest path
	Show lines
		Animated thick light blue dotted line, dotts move like marching ants
	Slight delay between moving units between tiles when using mouse movement
	Calculate base tiles by radius instead of hard-coded values
	
	Replace structures array with pointer to a ResourceStructure
	Bug: "Improvement already exists" instead of "Terraform complete"
	Make actions and status variables on the Game object
	Switch coordinates to x, y, z instead of z, y, x
	Structures of different classes can stack: ResourceStructure, MovementStructure, MilitaryStructure, ExtraResourceStructure
	Verify multiple engineers aggregate work correctly
		turns remaining should never be less than 1
		make totalProgress a static variable of the class
		un-assign all assigned units when one unit finishes production
		moving an engineer revokes its assignment
	Should not be able to "overwrite" city by building one on an existing one
	Prohibit bases from harvesting the same resource tiles, oldest base takes precedence
	Show outline of base radius before confirming build
	Show message log: population growth, production complete, terraform complete, structure already exists, etc.
	Population growth
	Base radius grows with population
	Accumulate nutrients/credits/minerals
	Research
	Society modules
	Unit designer: mixins, Object.prototype.assign(target, source)
	Economy bonus to cities connected with roads, attenuates exponentially with distance
	AI-controlled players
	Save/restore using Game object
	
	Modify interface mockup, implement blurred background effect, merge with prototype
	Preload all files automatically
	Base control should display around base
	
	Write to filesystem
	Multiplayer
	Convert to TypeScript
	Port to Unity
